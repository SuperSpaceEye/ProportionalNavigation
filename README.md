# ProportionalNavigation
2d and 3d functions for proportional navigation. Based of https://github.com/iwishiwasaneagle/proportional_navigation and implemented functions from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02APHAyHRMI&list=PLcmbTy9X3gXt02z1wNy4KF5ui0tKxdQm7&index=1
## Info
Input should be in an inertial frame already.


### 2D functions
1) pure_2d - pure proportional navigation rule in 2d
2) ZEM_2d - Zero Effort Miss in 2d
### 3D functions
1) ZEM_3D - Zero Effort Miss in 3d
